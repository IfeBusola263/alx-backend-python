## Python - Variable Annotations

* 0-add.py
```
a type-annotated function add that takes a float a and a float b as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
```
* 1-concat.py
```
a type-annotated function concat that takes a string str1 and a string str2 as arguments and returns a concatenated string
```
* 2-floor.py
```
a type-annotated function floor which takes a float n as argument and returns the floor of the float.
```
* 3-to_str.py
```
a type-annotated function to_str that takes a float n as argument and returns the string representation of the float.
```
* 4-define_variables.py
```
Contains annotated variables.
>> a, an integer with a value of 1.
>> pi, a float with a value of 3.14.
>> i_understand_annotations, a boolean with a value of True.

```
* 5-sum_list.py
```
a type-annotated function sum_list which takes a list input_list of floats as argument and returns their sum as a float.
```
* 6-sum_mixed_list.py
```
a type-annotated function sum_mixed_list which takes a list mxd_lst of integers and floats and returns their sum as a float.
```
* 7-to_kv.py
```
a type-annotated function to_kv that takes a string k and an int OR float v as arguments and returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the string k. The second element is the square of the int/float v and should be annotated as a float.
```
